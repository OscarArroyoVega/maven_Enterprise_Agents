        "**Colang** is a modeling language for conversational applications. We use Colang in NeMo-Guardrails to design how the conversation between a user and a bot should happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Colang, the two most important concepts for building are *messages* and *flows*.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Messages\n",
        "In Colang, a conversation is modeled as an exchange of messages between a user and a bot. An exchanged message has an utterance, such as \"What can you do?\", and a canonical form, such as `ask about capabilities`. A canonical form is a paraphrase of the utterance to a standard, usually shorter, form.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Colang, you can define the user and bot messages that are important for your LLM-based application. For example, an `express greeting` user message is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "define user express greeting\n",
        "  \"Hello\"\n",
        "  \"Hi\"\n",
        "  \"Wassup?\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `express greeting` represents the canonical form and \"Hello\", \"Hi\" and \"Wassup?\" represent example utterances. The role of the example utterances is to teach the bot the meaning of a defined canonical form. A canonical form is basically a paraphrase of the intent of a group of utterances.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Flows\n",
        "In Colang, flows represent patterns of interaction between the user and the bot. In their simplest form, they are sequences of user and bot messages. In the \"Hello World\" example, the greeting flow is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "define flow greeting\n",
        "  user express greeting\n",
        "  bot express greeting\n",
        "  bot ask how are you\n",
        "```\n",
        "This flow instructs the bot to respond with a greeting and ask how the user is feeling every time the user greets the bot.\n",

It acts as a filtration system by classifying content as safe or unsafe based on predefined categories, like violence, criminal planning, sexual content, or promotion of suicide & self-harm. Through the use of a taxonomy of harmful content categories, it ensures that AI-generated content adheres to ethical guidelines, preventing harmful or inappropriate material.\n",

        "In the following demo, we utilize a hosted serverless inference endpoint from [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/) to run the [LlamaGuard model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b). In order to follow along with this exercise, perform the below steps before you continue with the notebook:\n",
