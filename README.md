## What You'll Build

This course goes beyond theory. You'll build production-ready systems across four key phases:

### Phase 1 & 2: Building the Performance & Memory Engine
- **Optimized LLM Deployments** with quantization and KV caching
- **Agentic RAG Systems** with advanced retrieval and semantic caching
- **Knowledge Graph Applications** with RAG vs KG evaluation framework
- **Hybrid Memory Models** combining structured and unstructured data

### Phase 3 & 4: From Intelligence to Validated Action
- **ReAct Agent Systems** that reason and act autonomously
- **Multi-Agent Workflows** with ADK, A2A, and CrewAI orchestration
- **Production Guardrails** for safe AI deployment (Llama Guard)
- **LLM-based Evaluators** for comprehensive system validation
- **Interactive Dashboards** using Streamlit for real-time demos

Each module includes hands-on projects you can showcase in your portfolio.
